Salad is a helpful mix of some great BDD packages like lettuce and splinter, seasoned with some common modules. Its goal is to make writing acceptance tests downright fun.

Salad was originally developed at [Wieden+Kennedy](http://wk.com), and was then open-sourced under a BSD license.

As usage and contribution grew, it was moved into its own organization that is community-run.
